> [Karma](https://sreetamdas.com/karma) color theme by [Sreetam Das](https://github.com/sreetamdas) — ported to [iTerm2](https://iterm2.com).

Karma is a VS Code theme inspired by Ayu, Lucy, and Andromeda — vibrant accents on both dark and light backgrounds. This repository ports its palette into the `.itermcolors` format so your terminal matches your editor.

## Installation

1. Download a variant from [`colors/`](./colors) — see the table below for guidance.
2. Launch iTerm2 and open Settings (`⌘ + ,`).
3. Go to **Profiles** → select the profile you want to edit.
4. On the **Colors** tab, click **Color Presets** → **Import…**.
5. Pick the `.itermcolors` file you downloaded.
6. Open **Color Presets** again and select the imported preset.
7. Done. ✨

You can also grab pre-built `.itermcolors` directly from the [latest GitHub Release](https://github.com/aspatari/iterm2-karma/releases/latest).

## Variants

| Variant | File | When to use |
|---------|------|-------------|
| 🌙 Karma Dark | [`karma-dark.itermcolors`](./colors/karma-dark.itermcolors) | Default — Karma's signature dark theme |
| ☀️ Karma Light | [`karma-light.itermcolors`](./colors/karma-light.itermcolors) | Karma Light from VS Code — for bright environments |
| Karma Dark HC | [`karma-dark-hc.itermcolors`](./colors/karma-dark-hc.itermcolors) | High-contrast Dark — pure black background, amplified accents (outdoor / accessibility) |
| Karma Light HC | [`karma-light-hc.itermcolors`](./colors/karma-light-hc.itermcolors) | High-contrast Light — pure white background, deepened accents (projector / accessibility) |
| Karma Dark Dimmed | [`karma-dark-dimmed.itermcolors`](./colors/karma-dark-dimmed.itermcolors) | Dimmed Dark — softer accents, lifted background (OLED / late-night) |
| Karma Light Dimmed | [`karma-light-dimmed.itermcolors`](./colors/karma-light-dimmed.itermcolors) | Dimmed Light — off-white background, gentler accents (long reading sessions) |

All presets use the **refined ANSI 16 mapping** documented in the source comments of [`src/palette/dark.ts`](./src/palette/dark.ts) and [`src/palette/light.ts`](./src/palette/light.ts) — it sidesteps two quirks of Karma's verbatim `terminal.ansi*` ship values:

- **Dark:** `terminal.ansiBlue` and `ansiBrightBlue` are both set to orange in the upstream theme, which makes directories show as orange in `ls --color=auto`. The refined mapping uses Karma's cyan-blue instead.
- **Light:** `terminal.ansiBlack` is set to white (inverted ANSI 0/7 polarity), which breaks several CLI tools. The refined mapping uses dark for ANSI 0 and a mid-gray for ANSI 7.

The HC and Dimmed variants are derived from the Dark/Light bases via TypeScript object-spread overrides — only the cells that differ are listed explicitly. See [`src/palette/dark-hc.ts`](./src/palette/dark-hc.ts) etc. for the exact deltas.

## Recommended font

Karma's screenshots use [Iosevka](https://typeof.net/Iosevka/) (`Iosevka Term` or `Iosevka`). For the closest match to the original theme, configure the same font in iTerm2. Any other monospace font works correctly — the palette does not depend on the font.

## Building from source

The presets are produced by a Deno build script from a single TypeScript palette source in `src/palette/`. End users **do not need** Deno — all six `.itermcolors` files are committed to the repository.

```bash
# Requires Deno >= 2.0
deno task build
```

The script generates files in `colors/` deterministically: a second run produces no changes (this is enforced in CI via `git diff --exit-code colors/`). Full pipeline:

```bash
deno task fmt:check    # formatting
deno task lint         # linting
deno task check        # type-check (strict mode)
deno task test         # 23 unit tests for the hex parser
deno task build        # generate all 6 .itermcolors
```

The codebase follows a Layered + Functional Core / Imperative Shell pattern: `src/palette/` holds pure data, `src/render/` performs pure transformations, and `build.ts` is the only file that performs I/O. See the source comments and `AGENTS.md` for more.

## Screenshots

Recipe for reproducing the preview screenshots: [`assets/SCREENSHOTS.md`](./assets/SCREENSHOTS.md). The pipeline is fully automated — `freeze` renders the colored ANSI output of `assets/preview.sh` into a PNG without any GUI capture.
